## In the classroom
A short message: (& Site piloting)

Most people in our community know that the paper recycling bins in each classroom can be used for paper recycling. However, what you might not know is that along with paper recycling, people are free to put cans, bottles, and other recyclable goods in their classroom's blue bins! When it comes to this, there are still plenty of students (and even staff!) who are unaware of this information.

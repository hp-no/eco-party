## The Recent Fires

{{< youtube "CTaQHrB4Wto" >}}

**As of recent, many wildfires have been plaguing the country**. At first, it was mainly Alberta that was affected, but with such high temperatures and a lack of rainfall, wildfires have continued to spread beyond the province, and have started to pop up all over the country.

It's been having adverse effects on not only the environment, but on human beings as well, as governments issue states of emergency and air quality alerts as the smoke and fires affect not just parts of Canada, but in other places outside the country.

I wrote a **[summarized article]({{< ref "news/article-1.md" >}})** about what's been going on in the **News** section of the site, so for more concise infomation on this subject, feel free to give it a read!

Stay safe everyone!

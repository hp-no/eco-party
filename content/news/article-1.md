Starting around mid-May, dozens of wildfires began to plague Western Canada, many having started in [Alberta](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/alberta-wildfires-map-1.6838361) before moving outwards to surrounding provinces.

As of recently, the province of Alberta has declared and is currently under a state of emergency as a result of these fires.

In addition to Western Canada, wildfires have also begun to sprout and devastate parts east of the country, most notably, in the province of Nova Scotia. Thousands of people have been forced to evacuate from their homes in the capital city of Halifax, as the cityâ€™s wildfire situation has become out of control. In a [recent news release](https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20230529002) by the province, those forced to evacuate will receive some financial assistance to ease part of the monetary burden to arise from the situation.

Similarly to the province of Alberta, the city of Halifax has also declared and is under a state of emergency as a result.

The smoke from these fires have gone on to spread all over Canada and parts of the US, filling the air with smoke and drastically increasing the amount of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere. States such as Colorado and Montana have already issued an air quality alert because of it. It becomes increasingly evident that both the human and environmental impacts that have come as a result of the fires have been detrimental.

Experts believe that the cause of these wildfires are largely due to natural causes, with the record-high spring temperatures and a severe lack of rainfall playing an active role in these natural disasters.
